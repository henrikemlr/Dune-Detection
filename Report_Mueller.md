# Introduction
Barchan dunes are mainly found in areas where there is a limited supply of sand and where the wind blows uniformly from one direction throughout the year. They are characterized by a moon-like, crescent form (Bristow, 2019) and are the only migratory dune whose entire sand mass shifts with the wind direction (Brunotte et al., 2001). A barchan consists of a windward slope formed by grains of sand being transported uphill by saltation (Brunotte et al., 2001) and a slip surface on the lee side (Mahmoud, 2022). These dunes occur in arid regions worldwide, like Peru, Namibia, and Morocco (Sauermann et al., 2000).\
In Morocco the fast movement of barchan dunes is considered an environmental and socioeconomic problem (Dakir et al., 2016), as silting is a threat to settlements, oases, and different types of infrastructure (Elbelrhiti et al., 2023). Looking at different regions of Morocco, different problems are more prominent. For example, in the south-east of the country, oasis agricultural systems are threatened by silting of the palm groves, which serve as a protective barrier (Kacem et al., 2025). In the Atlantic Sahara region, silting causes the disruption of economic activity by clogging harbours, halting fishing operations, and causing maritime accidents, which can also lead to ecological consequences. Further, it impacts life on land by burying roads and buildings, forcing migration and causing high maintenance costs (Elbelrhiti et al., 2023). Considering all these widespread impacts, monitoring dune movements poses an important problem. \
Remote sensing methods are often useful when investigating vast areas like the Moroccan dessert. Therefore, different studies already investigated dune morphology and movement using satellite imagery and aerial photographs (Ben Kacem et al., 2025; Dakir et al., 2016; Elbelrhiti et al., 2008; Mahmoud, 2022). A few of those studies implemented a workflow for the automatic extraction of dunes and their movements using machine learning approaches. However, these approaches still rely on manual input, either during the collection of training data (Mahmoud, 2022) or during post-classification refinement steps (Dakir et al., 2016). \
Against this background the aim of this internship was to develop a more automated workflow for identifying and delineating dune features with a focus on the Atlantic Sahara region of Morocco. In particular, the potential of the Segment Anything Model 2 developed by Meta Platforms was investigated and tested on Sentinel 2 imagery. Segment Anything is a pre-trained image segmentation algorithm, which therefore is very efficient to use. The question to investigate is if this generally trained model can complete such a specific segmentation task.

# Regional Settings
The selected study area is part of the Atlantic Sahara region and the Tarfaya-Laayoune basin located in southwest Morocco. Between the cities of Tarfaya and Laayoune extends the longest barchan dune field on earth, consisting of different dune corridors (Elbelrhiti et al., 2008). The formation and persistence of barchan dunes require a specific combination of conditions, including a limited sand supply, a consistent unidirectional wind regime, and a firm, vegetation-free surface (Brunotte et al., 2001). All those conditions come together perfectly in the study area. \
In Morocco’s coastal regions beaches are the primary source of sand. However, these are frequently interrupted by coastal cliffs, which act as barriers and limit the transport of sand inland (Elbelrhiti et al., 2023). One of the main sediment sources feeding the dune corridors of the Atlantic Sahara is Cap Juby, located north of Tarfaya, where sand is mobilized by wind, initiating the formation of proto-dunes (Elbelrhiti, 2012). With a resultant drift potential of 0.91, the region exhibits one of the most unimodal wind regimes worldwide (Elbelrhiti, 2012). The dominant winds come from the north-west (337°) and largely match the observed direction of dune migration in this region (Elbelrhiti et al., 2008). Another essential condition is provided by the hard, vegetation-free surface that characterizes the area. The platform, known as the Dalle Moghrébienne, consists of a Plio-Pleistocene sandy limestone that facilitates the migration of barchan dunes (Elbelrhiti et al., 2023).

# Segment Anything
Developed by Meta AI, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a foundation model for image segmentation, generating high quality masks for a huge variety of images and objects. SAM was trained on over 11 million images and 1.1 billion masks (Kirillov et al., 2023), using a data engine consisting of different steps, moving from manual assistance to full automation already in the collection of the training masks. This diversity of the training lays the groundwork for SAM's unique zero-shot transfer that allows the model to be applied to new images and tasks not seen in training (Kirillov et al., 2023). The model’s transformer architecture consists of three components: a heavy-weight image encoder and mask encoder, as well as a light-weight mask decoder. \
Applying the model as a user requires minimal input, to be precise: just the image. The standard model, which is being delivered as the “Automatic Mask Generator”, sets a raster of 32 x 32 input points on the images and uses them as seed points for mask generation. But the density of the raster can be controlled along with other parameters. These include, for example, thresholds for mask prediction quality and stability (e.g., pred_iou_thresh, stability_score_thresh), and filtering criteria for overlapping masks using non-maximum suppression (e.g., box_nms_thresh). Beyond this automated approach, a characteristic feature of SAM is its promptable nature. Prompts can be provided in the form of positive and negative points, bounding boxes, or input masks.\
For this project the updated version SAM2 was used, which builds upon the original model by improving efficiency and enabling the processing of sequential data, thereby allowing segmentation to be extended from static images to video and multi-temporal image analysis (Ravi et al., 2024).\
Nevertheless, SAM exhibits some weaknesses that need to be considered when applying it. Firstly, the encoder uses a maximum resolution of 1024x1024 pixels, and larger images are downsampled internally. This means that the size of the input images is important for the quality of the mask output. Furthermore, during training, it became apparent that the model often overlooked smaller features and hallucinated small, unconnected features (Kirillov et al., 2023).

# Data
The method was developed using Sentinel data obtained from the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem. The selected study area is fully covered by tile 28RFR and Level-2A (bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance) products were used for the analysis. The used image was sensed on the 16th of January 2025. \
During the process of the workflow creation Landsat data was tested as well, but due to the higher spatial resolution, the decision was made for Sentinel imagery. 

# Preprocessing
The functionality of the Segment Anything Model requires a few preprocessing steps before being able to feed images into the algorithm. SAM’s image encoder uses an internal resolution of 1024x1024 pixels (Kirillov et al., 2023) which leads to a downsampling of input images with a higher resolution. To avoid an internal resampling process tiling the image was essential. But due to the lower performance of Sam on smaller objects (Kirillov et al., 2023) it was necessary to artificially increase the size of the dune objects before creating the tiles. This was reached by resampling the image. By increasing the resolution of the image fivefold each dune feature is represented by a greater number of pixels and are easier detectable for SAM. As a resampling method the Lancoscz interpolation was chosen, as it preserves details in high quality (Erdnüß & Müller, 2020). The tiles were then created from the resized image with the needed size of 1024x1024 and an overlap of 200 pixels. \
Dunes often show very subtle intensity or texture differences compared to their surroundings. In order to better distinguish between dune and background adaptive histogram equalization was applied to each tile. The CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) separates the image into 8x8 tiles and applies histogram equalization on each of these blocks. To avoid over-amplifying noise signals, a contrast limit is set, distributing every bin that is above that limit uniformly to other bins. In a last step, the equalized blocks are combined by using bilinear interpolation to remove borders (OpenCV). The results of this filtering step are exemplified in Figure 2.

For method development a limited number of tiles were chosen due to the heterogeneity of the general area of interest. The aim of this work is to develop a workflow for the detection of barchan dunes and laying the groundwork for a possible tracking. However, the chosen area of interest includes dunes in different states, including many coalescent dunes and, as well as various non-dune objects. This approach allows for a more controlled evaluation of the segmentation methodology by reducing potential sources of systematic error. The three tiles were chosen by visual inspection and represent different complexities of dune structure and the background (Figure 3).

# Automatic Mask Generator
Segment Anything provides different ways of generating masks: with or without user input. As explained, the Automatic Mask Generator does not require more than the image input itself but can be customized by choosing different parameters for the algorithm. While the general parameters chosen can be seen in Table 1, two different options were tested for the size of the input point grid (points per side): once 32x32 points were chosen and once 64x64 points.

| Parameter                                      | value  |
|------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Points per batch                               | 128    |
| Predicted iou treshold                         | 0.3    |
| Stability score threshold                      | 0.5    |
| Bounding Box Non-Maximum Suppression Threshold | 0.5    |
| Crop n layers                                  | 1      |
| Crop n points downscale factor                 | 2      |
| Minimum mask region area                       | 50     |

Table 1 Automatic Mask generator parameters 

Before being able to look at the mask outputs, they must be filtered by size. Due to the high number of input points, one mask covers the entire image in all of the three cases. \
Looking at the filtered mask outputs in Figure 4, they show that there is no big difference between the number of points per side. Both 32x32 and 64x64 produce reasonable results. In contrast, when comparing the results of the individual tiles, clear differences in the accuracy of the masks are noticeable. The output for tile number 145 (Figure 4A and 4B) appears to be almost perfect. All the dunes were detected, and the shape was also recognized for almost all of them. Only in the case of a single dune was the area inside the crescent included in the mask. One weakness is the placement of masks even between the dunes, which is likely due to the high number of input points even next to the objects. This becomes even more apparent on tile 240 (Figure 4C and 4D) where more background noise seems to amplify this problem. Additionally, the masks on the actual dunes seem less robust. Tile 243 (Figure 4E and 4F) seem to produce even bigger problems for SAM, only a few dunes are detected clearly. \
In general, it can therefore be summarized that the detection works very reliably if the dunes are clearly distinguishable from the background and are fairly isolated from each other.

# Manual Input Points
Another option of generating masks with SAM2 is to feed your own input points into the model. This was firstly done for all three tiles by clicking the points manually and using the respective coordinates as seed points (see Figure 5). \
In comparison with the output of the Automatic Mask Generator the results for tile 145 show only minor differences. While fewer masks are detected in the background, the overall quality of the masks remains similar to the first automatically generated output. The results for tile 243, on the other hand, appear to show a significant improvement. Although smaller dunes are still not reliably detected and some incorrect masks remain, the majority of the dunes have been detected, and the outcomes are cleaner and clearer. Noise like in tile 240 still leads to masks with a high error rate. Even though some of the dunes have been detected, the geometry of the masks does not accurately represent the shapes of the dunes. \
Considering the major improvements in tile 243 and the consistency of the output in tile 145, the conclusion can be drawn that when the input points are located on the dunes SAM produces results of higher quality, at least when examining them visually.

# Seed Point Generation
Selecting input points on a few tiles like in the examples shown before is fast and easy. Though to create a truly automatic segmentation workflow and be able to apply it to bigger datasets, a different way of choosing the seed points must be implemented. Different methods were tested to set points. For example, working with SIFT-Features was taken into consideration, but no reasonable results could be reached. The final procedure to extract seed points consists of a combination of the Gaussian Filter and the Laplace filter. \
In a first step it was necessary to distinguish the dunes from the background and therefore minimize the influence of noise that resembles structures. Applying a Gaussian filter to the image produces an approximation of the background (Figure 6B) which was then subtracted from the original input image (Figure 6C). A grayscale image was then computed as the mean of the RGB channels, enhancing intensity-based edges (Figure 6D). On this grayscale image a Laplacian filter was applied to identify the before enhanced edges (Figure 6E). High Laplacian responses (both negative and positive) where thresholded to obtain a binary mask. Next, a binary closing operation was performed on the extracted values, connecting nearby pixels by bridging gaps and filling smaller holes (Figure 6F). In a last processing step the now connected objects were labelled and filtered for features of a size smaller than 50 pixels to remove fragments (Figure 6G). The remaining regions were assumed to be the candidate dune features and for each one the pixel with maximum Laplacian response was selected as the seed point for SAM (Figure 6H). \

# Discussion
The question posed in the beginning was if the generally trained Segment Anything Model can be used to efficiently detect dunes in satellite imagery and therefore deliver a groundwork for tracking their movement. Looking at the results of the segmentation process, the question can be answered positively. While having a low amount of manual work the mask outputs, especially for two out of the three example tiles, look promising upon visual inspection. Generating the seed points using the proposed workflow cuts the manual work even more and only the preprocessing must be done separately. But while reaching the proof of concept, there are still a lot of issues. For example, the process only produces high-quality results on tiles with a relatively simple structure and a clear distinction between the dunes and the background. Fragments in the background or merged dunes immediately lead to a lower accuracy of the mask output. Which leads to another challenge of the process. The lack of ground-truth datasets for this region makes it impossible to validate and quantify the actual accuracy of the output, and any assessment of the quality of the results is purely visual and subjective. This also leads to a problem when choosing the correct mask output of SAM. When working with individual input points, SAM2 delivers three different mask outputs and the quality of those tend to vary quite a bit, which often simplifies the decision. However, sometimes it’s harder to evaluate just by the visual inspection which output is the most accurate. Furthermore, each tile must be examined individually, requiring a manual step in the postprocessing. This contradicts the goal of a fully automated process.
Future work should improve those problems. Starting with the initial detection of the dunes, it would be possible to finetune the Segment Anything Model for this specific use case. While being trained on universal image data it is possible to adjust SAMs model weights with individual data, but the lack of ground truth data remains a problem. In contrast, other remote sensing applications have already benefited from model finetuning due to the availability of training datasets. An example is automatic field delineation, where sufficient annotated data has enabled effective training (Scribano et al., 2025). This is not possible for our use case. \
Furthermore, the process needs to be improved in the post-processing and could, for example, improve the reduction of mask fragments in the final output. This maybe could be done by filtering the mask shapes, but the exact method would require further examination.
